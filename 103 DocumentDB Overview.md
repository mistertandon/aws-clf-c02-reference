## 198. Amazon DocumentDB

Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a fully managed NoSQL database service optimized for JSON-based document storage and processing. It provides MongoDB-compatible functionality, enabling seamless migration and integration of applications built on MongoDB.

DocumentDB is architected for high availability and scalability, replicating data across three Availability Zones to ensure fault tolerance and durability. Its storage layer automatically scales in 10-GB increments, accommodating dynamic workloads without manual intervention. The service is designed to handle millions of requests per second, making it ideal for applications requiring high throughput and low-latency data access.

Similar to Amazon Auroraâ€™s approach for relational databases, DocumentDB offers a cloud-native deployment model. It abstracts the complexities of database management, including patching, backups, and scaling, allowing developers to focus on building applications. By integrating seamlessly with the AWS ecosystem, DocumentDB supports use cases such as real-time analytics, content management, and IoT data ingestion.
