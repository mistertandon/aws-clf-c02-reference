## 199. Amazon Neptune

Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph database service designed for highly connected datasets. It excels in scenarios such as social networks, where entities (users, posts) and their relationships (likes, comments, shares) form complex graphs. 

Neptune provides high availability with replication across three Availability Zones and supports up to 15 low-latency read replicas. It is optimized for applications requiring efficient execution of complex graph queries, enabling the storage of billions of relationships while maintaining millisecond-level query latencies. 

Neptune supports both property graph and RDF graph models, making it versatile for use cases like knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikipedia's interlinked articles), fraud detection, recommendation systems, and social networking applications. Its architecture ensures fault tolerance, scalability, and seamless integration with other AWS services, offering a robust solution for graph-based data workloads.
