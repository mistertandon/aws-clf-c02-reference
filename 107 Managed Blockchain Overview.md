Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed AWS service that simplifies the creation and management of Blockchain networks. 

Blockchain, by design, enables decentralized applications where multiple participants can execute transactions without depending on a central trusted authority. This eliminates the need for intermediaries, ensuring transparency and trust.

With Amazon Managed Blockchain, you can seamlessly join existing public Blockchain networks or set up a private, scalable Blockchain network tailored to your organizational needs. The service supports two leading frameworks: **Hyperledger Fabric** for private networks requiring strong access controls and **Ethereum** for decentralized applications on public Blockchain networks.
