To migrate data between databases, AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) provides an efficient and secure solution. DMS enables the extraction of data from a source database using an EC2 instance running DMS software. After extraction, DMS automatically loads the data into the target database, which can be hosted on AWS or another location.

DMS ensures minimal disruption during migration by allowing the source database to remain operational, eliminating downtime. It supports both homogeneous migrations, such as Oracle to Oracle, and heterogeneous migrations, like SQL Server to Aurora. For heterogeneous migrations, DMS seamlessly converts data between different formats, ensuring compatibility between source and target databases.

This service offers built-in resilience and self-healing capabilities, optimizing migration performance and reducing operational risk.
