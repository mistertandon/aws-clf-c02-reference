DynamoDB Global Tables enable low-latency, multi-region access to your data, providing seamless active-active replication across up to 10 AWS Regions. This feature ensures high availability, disaster recovery, and optimized performance for globally distributed applications.

For example, if you configure a DynamoDB table in the `us-east-1` Region as a Global Table, you can replicate it to other Regions, such as `eu-west-3` (Paris). This bidirectional replication ensures that data written in one Region is automatically synchronized across all other Regions. Users in Paris can access the table with minimal latency while maintaining consistency with the `us-east-1` data.

Global Tables automatically manage data replication and conflict resolution, allowing users to read from and write to any replicated Region without manual intervention. This setup is ideal for applications requiring globally distributed workloads, such as gaming leaderboards, e-commerce platforms, and real-time analytics systems.

With native integration into the DynamoDB service, Global Tables deliver a robust and cost-efficient solution for building globally available, low-latency applications without the complexity of custom replication or synchronization logic.
